# Face-Detector

I'm thrilled to share my newest Flutter creation, a project that harnesses the power of Google's ML Kit for face detection. 
With this app you can accurately count tracked faces. Built with Flutter and Dart, and integrated with Google APIs, it's a testament to the exciting possibilities of modern app development.
